In this project, I will apply Natural Language Processing on corporate filings, such as 10Q and 10K statements, from cleaning data and text processing, to feature extraction and modeling. Also will utilize bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company-specific sentiments. Based on the sentiments, then decide which company to invest in, and the optimal time to buy or sell.
