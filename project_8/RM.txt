In this project, I will build a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and it will implement it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. It will also use performance attribution to identify the major drivers of the portfolioâ€™s profit-and-loss (PnL). Then will have the option to modify and customize the backtest as well.
